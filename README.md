## Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Deliverable I)
#### To begin this analysis, it is best list the results from the regression model.  As such:

#### From all the variables listed; Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) the ones that had the most significant effect on the slope line were:
-	Vehicle Length
-	Ground Clearance
-	All Wheel Drive

#### Secondly, a plot of the data would reveal that the slope does not equal zero or close to zero but utilizing the p-value from the analysis and using the stated context in 15.7.2 we can see that:

-	P-value = 2.6E-6 which is << that 5.0E-2 and…

#### “Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.”
